# EcoDraft
EcoDraft™ is a regenerative cooling and purification system that replaces energy-hungry AC with smart airflow, advanced filtration, and bio-seeding. Each unit acts as a home “lung,” cleaning air while linking into a decentralized climate mesh—transforming houses into planetary nodes of balance, resilience, and renewal.
