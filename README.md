## 🌬️ Short Description

**EcoDraft™ is a regenerative cooling and purification system that replaces energy-hungry AC with smart airflow, advanced filtration, and optional bio-seeding. Each unit acts as a home “lung,” cleaning air while linking into a decentralized climate mesh—transforming households into planetary nodes of balance, resilience, and renewal.**

## 🌱 Vision & Principles

EcoDraft™ is designed under the **Zero Harm Override**:  
- **Peace First** — No tech that harms life.  
- **Unity of Peoples** — Open-source and globally replicable.  
- **Sovereignty Guard** — Local-first, user-owned data.  
- **Tech as Adaptation** — Designed to serve biosphere balance, not extract it.

## 🌀 System Overview

EcoDraft™ combines **natural draft mechanics, smart fans, and advanced filtration** into a modular system.  
It cools air, scrubs pollutants, and can sync with other nodes to form a **climate mesh** that regulates airflow across communities.

📦 Bill of Materials & Sourcing
	•	Fans / Blowers: Efficient DC fans (Noctua/Delta industrial-grade).
	•	Filters:
	•	HEPA H13 (particulate)
	•	Activated Carbon (VOCs, smoke)
	•	Bio/Myco Layer (optional regenerative filter)
	•	Sensors: PM2.5/PM10, CO₂, humidity, temp, VOC, airflow pressure.
	•	Electronics: ESP32 / STM32 microcontrollers, modular PCBs, relays.
	•	Enclosure: Recyclable composites, modular panels, 3D-printable designs.
	•	Networking: WiFi, LoRa, or mesh protocols (ESP-NOW, Thread).

Sourcing strategy:
	•	Open hardware vendors (Adafruit, SparkFun, DigiKey).
	•	Community fab labs for enclosures.
	•	Open blueprints published for 3D-printed components.

⸻

🛡️ Safety & Compliance
	•	Electrical grounding & insulation checks.
	•	Fire safety: low-voltage DC only.
	•	Filters meet ASTM / WHO standards for particulate removal.
	•	All bio-seeding modules locked behind Zero Harm approval gates.

⸻

🔧 Mechanical Build
	•	Intake + exhaust ducts with noise-dampening baffles.
	•	Quick-release filter slots for modular swap.
	•	Gasket-sealed enclosure to prevent leaks.
	•	Adjustable output vents for room-scale airflow tuning.

⸻

🌫️ Filtration Stack
	1.	Pre-filter: captures large dust & insects.
	2.	HEPA H13: removes fine particulates.
	3.	Activated Carbon: absorbs VOCs & smoke.
	4.	Bio/Myco Layer (optional): fungal spores or probiotic agents for ecosystem repair.

⸻

⚡ Electronics & Controls
	•	MCU (ESP32/STM32) for sensor reading + fan control.
	•	Control loop: maintain desired indoor air quality + cooling targets.
	•	Safety fallback: if sensors fail, system defaults to passive draft.

⸻

💻 Firmware Basics
	•	Written in C++ / MicroPython.
	•	Features:
	•	Sensor polling
	•	Fan speed modulation
	•	Local data logging (SD card)
	•	Secure hashing of configs (SHA256)
	•	OTA (Over-the-Air) updates optional but never required.

⸻

🌐 Mesh Networking
	•	Node sync protocols: LoRa, ESP-NOW, or Matter.
	•	Nodes share air quality + climate telemetry.
	•	Local-first: no cloud dependency.
	•	Privacy-respecting: logs stay on-device unless shared.

⸻

🧪 Commissioning & Tests
	•	Airflow Test: anemometer readings vs. spec.
	•	Pressure Drop: across filter stack.
	•	AQI Calibration: cross-check with reference sensors.
	•	Noise Profile: dB monitoring at various duty cycles.

⸻
